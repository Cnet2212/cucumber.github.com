# {{page.title}}

The [Cucumber discussion forum](groups.google.com/group/cukes) has thousands of users, and to ensure
effective communication there are a few rules you are asked to follow. If you fail to follow any of
these rules, chances are high that your message will be ignored.

### 1) Use interleaved answers

Consider this discussion:

> Because it messes up the order in which people normally read text.<br><br>
>> Why is top-posting such a bad thing?<br><br>
>>> Top-posting.<br><br>
>>>> What is the most annoying thing in e-mail?<br>

If you make the effort to place your follow-up remarks *below* the most relevant section of the text you are replying to,
then reading the conversation becomes a lot easier to read than the above. As a result,and more people are likely to join the conversation, and there will be less misunderstandings.

So instead of "top posting", please use interleaved answers:

>>>> What is the most annoying thing in e-mail?
>>> Top-posting.
>> Why is top-posting such a bad thing?
> Because it messes up the order in which people normally read text.

Now, go tell a friend and maybe we can get a discussion going on HN!

### 2) Prefix subjects

The Cucumber discussion forum is used to discuss many topics. To help group members quickly decide
whether or not a post is of interest to them, please use a prefix in your subject. Here are some
examples:

* \[JVM\] How can I exclude certain scenarios from a run?
* \[Ruby\] Step Definition doesn't match my step
* \[JS\] Has anyone used Cucumber-JS with Karma?

### 3) Don't hijack threads

If you have a question, don't reply to an existing (irrelevant) message. Start a new topic instead.

### 4) Don't email people privately

If you want to know why, read [this post](http://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2013/10/08/dont-email-me/).
