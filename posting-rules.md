The [Cucumber discussion forum](groups.google.com/group/cukes) has thousands of users. We have come up with
a few guidelines to improve communication efficiency. It can often be difficult to keep up with all the great
posts on this forum, but if you follow these guidelines you're more likely to be heard and get a reply.

### 1) Search before you ask

We have a machine learning intelligent filter that will automatically reject your message if it detects that 
you haven't been [searching the archive](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cukes) for answers in the past 
10 minutes. The filter is tested with Cucumber and therefore guaranteed to be working.

### 2) Use interleaved answers

Consider this discussion:

> Because it messes up the order in which people normally read text.<br><br>
>> Why is top-posting such a bad thing?<br><br>
>>> Top-posting.<br><br>
>>>> What is the most annoying thing in e-mail?<br>

If you make the effort to place your follow-up remarks *below* the most relevant section of the text you are replying to,
then reading the conversation becomes a lot easier to read than the above. As a result more people are likely to join the conversation, and there will be fewer misunderstandings.

So instead of "top posting", please use interleaved answers:

>>>> What is the most annoying thing in e-mail?
>>> Top-posting.
>> Why is top-posting such a bad thing?
> Because it messes up the order in which people normally read text.

### 3) Prefix subjects

The Cucumber discussion forum is used to discuss many topics. To help group members quickly decide
whether or not a post is of interest to them, please use a prefix in your subject. Here are some
examples:

* \[JVM\] How can I exclude certain scenarios from a run?
* \[Ruby\] Step Definition doesn't match my step
* \[JS\] Has anyone used Cucumber-JS with Karma?

### 4) Don't hijack threads

If you have a question, don't reply to an existing (irrelevant) message. Start a new topic instead.

### 5) Don't email people privately

If you want to know why, read [this post](http://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2013/10/08/dont-email-me/).
