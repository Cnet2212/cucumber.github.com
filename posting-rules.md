# {{page.title}}

The [Cucumber discussion forum](groups.google.com/group/cukes) has thousands of users, and to ensure
effective communication there are a few rules you are asked to follow. If you fail to follow any of
these rules, chances are high that your message will be ignored.

### 1) Use interleaved answers

Consider this discussion:

> Because it messes up the order in which people normally read text.<br>
>> Why is top-posting such a bad thing?<br>
>>> Top-posting.<br>
>>>> What is the most annoying thing in e-mail?<br>

The style above is called top posting. The most recent posts are at the top. This style is _strongly_ discouraged
on the Cucumber discussion forum because it makes it very hard to follow long conversations between multiple people.

Instead, use interleaved answers:

>>>> What is the most annoying thing in e-mail?
>>> Top-posting.
>> Why is top-posting such a bad thing?
> Because it messes up the order in which people normally read text.

This style also makes it easier to answer multiple questions, right underneath the question.

### 2) Prefix subjects

The Cucumber discussion forum is used to discuss many topics. To help group members quickly decide
whether or not a post is of interest to them, please use a prefix in your subject. Here are some
examples:

* \[JVM\] How can I exclude certain scenarios from a run?
* \[Ruby\] Step Definition doesn't match my step
* \[JS\] Has anyone used Cucumber-JS with Karma?

### 3) Don't hijack threads

If you have a question, don't reply to an existing (irrelevant) message. Start a new topic instead.

### 4) Don't email people privately

If you want to know why, read [this post](http://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2013/10/08/dont-email-me/).
