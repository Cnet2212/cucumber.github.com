# {{page.title}}

The [Cucumber discussion forum](groups.google.com/group/cukes) has thousands of users, and to ensure
effective communication there are a few rules you are asked to follow. If you fail to follow any of
these rules, chances are high that your message will be ignored.

If you have been sent to this page, just resubmit your message according to the posting rules.

### 1) Use interleaved answers

Consider this discussion:

> Because it messes up the order in which people normally read text.<br>
> Why is top-posting such a bad thing?<br>
> Top-posting.<br>
> What is the most annoying thing in e-mail?<br>

The style above is called top posting, and it is strongly discouraged on the Cucumber discussion forum.
Instead, use interleaved answers:

> What is the most annoying thing in e-mail?
>> Top-posting.
>>> Why is top-posting such a bad thing?
>>>> Because it messes up the order in which people normally read text.

### 2) Prefix subjects

The Cucumber discussion forum is used to discuss many things. To help other members quickly decide
whether or not a post is of interest to them, please use a prefix in your subject. Here are some
examples:

* \[JVM\] How can I exclude certain scenarios from a run?
* \[Ruby\] Step Definition doesn't match my step
* \[JS\] Has anyone used Cucumber-JS with Karma?

### 3) Don't hijack threads

If you have a question, don't reply to an existing (irrelevant) message. Start a new topic instead.

### 4) Don't email people privately

If you want to know why, read [this post](http://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2013/10/08/dont-email-me/).
