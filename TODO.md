## Layout

### Landing page

The landing page doesn't need a top menu. It should feature:

* Semi-big logo
* 1-2 short paragraphs about Cucumber
** Executable specifications
** Workflow image
** Site Navigation section
** Many platforms/frameworks
** IDE support
** i18n
** Companies using Cucumber
* Picture of Cucumber books
